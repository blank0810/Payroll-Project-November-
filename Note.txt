UPDATES NEED TO BE DONE AFTER THE CREATING THE PROTOTYPE

* CREATE A FUNCTION FOR PROPER VALIDATION SUCH AS CHECKING IF THE USER ALLOWED CAN BE DONE AFTER CREATING THE FOLLOWING UPDATE
	* CREATE A TABLE FOR THE LIST OF EVERY FUNCTION IN THE DATABASE
	* CREATE THE TABLE THAT CONSIST OF EVERY USER ROLE ALONG WITH THE FUNCTIONS ASSIGNED TO THEM

* CREATE THE PLATFORM FOR THE SYSTEM ADMIN
* LIST THE SYSTEM ADMINSITRATOR FUNCTIONS
	* ADD DEPARTMENT
	* MODIFY DEPARTMENT DETAILS
	* TO APPOINT MAYOR, VICE MAYOR, DEPARTMENT HEAD POSITIONS
	* TO GIVE ACCESS TO FUNCTIONS TO EACH USER (THOUGH THIS IS ONLY AFTER THE PROTOTYPE)
	* TO ADD NEW BENEFITS AND DEDUCTIONS ALSO ALLOCATE IT IF ITS MANDATORY, OR EXCLUSIVE ONLY TO REGULAR/JOB ORDER EMPLOYEES

	* TO DISPLAY THE SYSTEM LOGS
	* TO DISPLAY FORM/EMPLOYEE DATA LOGS
	* TO MODIFY/MANUALLY INPUT THE CURRENT OR BEING USED SALARY GRADE OF THE LGU AS WELL AS THE STEPS INCREMENT VALUES IF THERE IS NO COMPUTATIONS TO BE FOUND

* CREATE A TABLE IN SQL FOR THE EVERY FORM IN THE SYSTEM AND WHAT TABLE THEY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH

* CREATE A FUNCTION THAT WOULD RETRIEVE THE NAME OF THE TABLE BASE ON WHAT FORM

* CREATE A FUNCTION THAT WOULD CHECK IF THE REQUEST FILED (INCLUDING LEAVE, TRAVEL ORDER, AND PASS SLIP) IS STILL VALID
	* EXAMPLE THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF DAY TO FILE A REQUEST IS THAT 5 DAYS BEFORE THE DESIGNATED DATE OF LEAVE, TRAVEL ORDER, AND PASS SLIP

* CREATE A NEW COLUMN ON APPOINTMENT FORM OR A NEW TABLE DEPENDING ON THE SETTING THAT WOULD TRACK THE NUMBER OF LEAVE, TRAVEL ORDER, AND PASS SLIP THE 
	EMPLOYEE ALLOWED TO FILE

* CREATE A PROPER HASHING FOR THE EMPLOYEE PASSWORD

* CREATE A STORED PROCEDURE FOR UPDATING, INSERTING DATA INTO THE DATABASE

* CREATE A FUNCTION FOR RETRIEVING VALUES FROM THE DATABASE

* AFTER CODING THE WHOLE PERSONNEL PLATFORM YOU NEED TO SEGREGATE THE FUNCTIONS INTO CLASSES / CLASSIFY THOSE GENERAL FUNCTIONS AND SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS IN DIFFERENT CLASSES

* CREATE AN OVERTIME REQUESTS NEEDS TO BE ADDED

* CREATE TRIGGERS FOR SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS
	* TRIGGERS FOR COMPUTING THE TOTAL HOURS OF WORKED WHEN THE TIME IS PAST 6 PM
	* TRIGGERS FOR AUTOMATICALLY PUTTING ACTIVE STATUS FOR THE EMPLOYEE BENEFIT

* AFTER EVERYTHING THE PLATFORM START CREATING FOR THE PAYROLL TO COMPUTE

* AFTER THAT MAKE IT THAT IT WILL GENERATE DOCUMENTS SUCH AS PDF THAT CAN BE SAVED

* AFTER REVISE THE CODE FOR MORE MODULARITY AND ENCAPSULATE (PRIORITY TRAVEL ORDER AND PASS SLIP CREATION)

* ALSO WHEN CREATING FOR THE SYSTEM ADMIN REMEMBER THAT IN SYSTEM LOGS INSTEAD REMEMBER THAT ITS USER ID AND EMPLOYEE ID
	ARE THE ONE BEING INPUT MAKE SURE THAT IN THE UI IT IS CLICKABLE WHERE THE SYSTEM ADMIN CAN REVEAL THE USER DETAILS OF THAT USER
	AND EMPLOYEE

* CREATE THE WINDOWS SERVICE FOR THE API AND BACKGROUND WORKERS NECESARRY FOR THE SYSTEM

* CREATE A FILTERATION FOR THE FORM LOGS IN THE HR PLATFORM ON THE EMPLOYEE DETAILS

* CREATE A FILTERATION FOR THE PERSONAL PORTAL LEAVE LOGS, TRAVEL ORDER LOGS, AND PASS SLIP LOGS

* CHANGE THE WAY IMAGE IS STORED IN THE DATABASE - MAKE IT THAT INSTEAD OF FULL FILE PATH STORE ONLY THE FILE NAME THEN UTILIZE THE FILE PATH THAT IS SAVED IN THE 
	CONFIGURATION FILE PURPOSE FOR THIS IS FOR SCALABILITY MAKING THAT EVEN IF THE IMAGES IS MOVED TO ANOTHER SERVER ONLY THE CONFIGURATION FILE IS NEEDED TO BE CHANGED

* BEFORE FILING AND APPROVING CHECK IF THERE IS EXISTING SCHEDULE ON THAT DATE FOR EXAMPLE WHEN FILING A LEAVE FOR THAT MAKE IT SURE THAT DURING THAT DAY THERE IS NO 
	SCHEDULED TRAVEL ORDER OR PASS SLIP IT GOES THE SAME ALSO FOR THE TRAVEL AND PASS SLIP

*USE ConfigureAwait(false); IN EVERY ASYNC AND AWAIT FUNCTIONS IN THE SYSTEM TO AVOID POTENTIAL DEADLOCK

* MODIFY ALL CONNECTION METHODS TO USE TRANSACTION, COMMIT, AND ROLLBACK THIS IS FOR POTENTIAL ERRORS TO BE CORRECTED / OR IMPLEMENT THIS ONLY WHEN 
	CREATING THE STORED PROCEDURES
